# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArithmeticException` caused by division by zero.  The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides a corrected version.

The bug is in the `main` method where an integer variable is divided by zero, resulting in an `ArithmeticException`.

The solution implements a check to ensure the denominator is not zero before performing the division.
